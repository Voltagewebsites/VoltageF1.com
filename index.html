    <br> <h1> 1.) Ayrton Senna. </h1> </br> <h2> Ayrton Senna is our pick for the BEST F1 driver to ever exist. He dominated the pack and won 3 world championships. He had so much more success ahead of him if the tragic incident of Imola did not occur then he might be the most successful Formula 1 driver in existence. He had most of his success in the mp4/4 where McLaren won 15/16 races of the season. That is why Ayrton Senna is our pick for the <strong> greatest Formula 1 driver in history. </strong>  </h2> </br>
